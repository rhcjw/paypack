## The Problem

The HTTP 402 status code has existed in the protocol specification since **1991**. For over three decades, it has never been used in practice.

Why? Because when a server returns "Payment Required," there must be a human on the other end of the screen to pull out a credit card.

**AI Agents change everything.**

An autonomous AI agent can make hundreds of API calls, data purchases, and content subscriptions per hour — with individual amounts as small as **$0.001**. Traditional payment systems collapse under micro-transaction fees and the need for manual approval.

**x402** (proposed by Coinbase) and **AP2** (proposed by Google) are solving this: the server returns 402 with a payee address and amount, and the AI agent completes the on-chain payment automatically — all within a single HTTP round trip. No human intervention required.

**PayPack's mission**: to be the **thinnest, most reliable, most indispensable middleware layer** in the AI payment stack.

PayPack doesn't invent new protocols. It wraps scattered capabilities into a single `agent.pay()`.

## Features

- **Multi-Protocol**: Supports both x402 and AP2 with automatic detection
- **Signer Abstraction**: Pluggable signing — LocalSigner for dev, AWSKMSSigner for production (private key never leaves HSM)
- **Nano-Payment Optimized**: Built for sub-$0.01 transactions with ERC-4337 batch settlement to save gas
- **Security Fuse**: Daily spend limits, balance checks, auditable receipts
- **Full Audit Trail**: Every payment generates a queryable JSON receipt
- **LangChain Native**: Drop-in `PayPackTool` for LangChain agents
- **Dual Compliance Track**: USDC on-chain + Alipay AI Pay (planned)

## Installation

```bash
pip install https://gitee.com/rhcjw_com/paypack/raw/master/dist/langchain_paypack-0.5.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

> **Note**: Includes the full `paypack` SDK (core + signer + nanopay).

---

## Quick Start

```python
from paypack import AgentPay

# Initialize
pay = AgentPay(
    wallet_config={"private_key": "your-key"},
    network="base-sepolia",
    spend_limit_daily=10.0,
    broadcast=False
)

# Scenario 1: Auto-handle HTTP 402
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.data-provider.com/premium")
if response.status_code == 402:
    content = pay.auto_handle_402(response)

# Scenario 2: Direct nano-payment
receipt = pay.send(
    to="0xRecipientAddress",
    amount=0.001,
    currency="USDC"
)
print(receipt["tx_hash"])
```

### LangChain Integration

```python
from langchain_paypack import PayPackTool

tool = PayPackTool(
    private_key="0x...",
    wallet_address="0x...",
    network="base-sepolia",
    spend_limit_daily=10.0,
    broadcast=False
)

# AI agent calls this directly
result = tool._run(to="0x...", amount=0.001, currency="USDC")
print(result)
```

| Currency | Amount | Offline-Signed TX Hash |
|----------|--------|------------------------|
| ETH | 0.0001 ETH | `d5f7ec94342c26a132289a9898ffd4885010089d1ddba19951117618a3992127` |

| v0.2 | AP2 protocol support | ✅ Done |
| v0.3 | LangChain plugin release | ✅ Done |
| v0.4 | Signer abstraction + ERC-4337 batch settlement | ✅ Done |
| v0.5 | RPC failover + retry + limit persistence | ✅ Done |
| v0.6 | Alipay AI Pay integration | 🚧 Planned |
| v1.0 | PayPack Cloud (hosted service) | 🚧 Planned |

## Why Now?

- Stablecoin annual transaction volume surpassed **$33 trillion** (2025) — 20x PayPal
- AI agent count projected to reach **22 billion** (McKinsey)
- x402 protocol already processes tens of millions of transactions on Solana
- LangChain/LlamaIndex payment plugin market is **completely vacant**

Infrastructure is ready. Demand is exploding. The payment layer lacks a standard answer.
